### Due: Friday 9/19 at 10pm

This assignment has a total of 22 pts possible. Your score out of 20 will noted and scaled to 5 points (maximum of 5).

**Question 1 -- Conceptual Questions:** (1pt each)

  - **Part A** What does it mean to say two variables are *associated* with each other?

  - **Part B** What does it mean to say two variables are *independent* of each other?
  
  - **Part C** What does the distribution of a variable tell us?

**Question 2** For this question, we will be using the `iris` dataset, giving the measurements, in centimeters, of the variables for sepal and petal length and width. You can read more on the dataset [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). An image of what these variables correspond to on a flower are provided below.

**NOTE:** You will need to edit out the image from your document in order for it to knit to a .pdf doc. If your doc does not knit, this may be the cause.

```{r, out.width = "400px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("IrisImage.jpg")
```

To load this data into R, simply copy and paste the following into your Rmd file in an R code chunk

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(iris)
```

Use this data to answer the following questions:

  - **Part A** How many observations and variables are in the `iris` dataset? In one sentence, briefly describe what constitutes an observation in this data. (2 pts)
  
  - **Part B** Use the code below to create the appropriate plot to visualize the relationship between the variables `Sepal.Width` and `Sepal.Length`. Do these two variables appear to be *associated*? If so, comment on the strength of this association. (2 pt)
  
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)) + geom_point()
```
  
  - **Part C** Use the code below to create the plot again, this time adding additional information for the variable `Species`. Has anything changed in the association between `Sepal.Width` and `Sepal.Length`? Comment on the **strength**, **form**, and **direction** of any associations you see (1pt)

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, color = Species)) + geom_point()
```


**Question 3:**

From the [IMS Textbook](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/), do the following exercises (you do not need to read anything from the textbook to answer these): 

- Chapter 4.8: Questions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Ch 5.10: Questions 11, 13

Write your answers to these exercises below.
