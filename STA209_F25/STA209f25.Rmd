### Exam 1 Materials

[[Practice Exam 1]](Exams/practice_exam1.pdf)

[[Exam 1 Topics List]](Exams/topic_list_exam1.html)

### Exam 2 Materials

The best thing you can do to prepare for the exam is to go through the confidence interval and hypothesis test labs + homeworks. Extra material will be posted here early in Week 11.

[Exam 2 Topics Outline](Exams/topic_list_exam2.html)

[Exam 2 Short Answer Practice](Exams/exam2_shortanswer.html)

[Exam 2 Practice](Exams/practice_exam2.html)

[Exam 2 Practice Extra](Exams/practice_exam2_extra.pdf)

[Exam 2 Formula Sheet](Exams/exam2_formulas.pdf) All of this will appear as a page at the end of the exam. I may have to format it slightly differently to fit.

### Exam 3 Materials

The best prep you will have for this exam is going through the regression and ANOVA labs + HW7 and spending time to fully understand all parts. Most of the questions will be structured in ways similar to the labs. HW7 solutions will be posted on Saturday morning (after it is due). 

Below is some extra material you may find helpful. There are not extensive formulas for this exam, only those related to ANOVA will be needed. Linear regression concepts will be tested, but formulas for slopes/intercepts are unnecessary.

[Exam 3 Topics List](Exams/Exam_3_Topics_List.pdf)

[Exam 3 Short Answer Practice](Exams/exam3_shortanswer.html)
