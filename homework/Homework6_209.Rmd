This assignment has 25 points possible. Your score will be calculated out of 22 points and scaled to be out of 5 points. 

# Question 1 -- Sex Equality (4 pts)

The General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1,390 Americans the following question: “On the whole, do you think it should or should not be the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women?” 82\% of the respondents said it “should be”. At a 95\% confidence level, this sample has 2\% margin of error. Based on this
information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning. (NORC 2016)

**Part A**: We are 95% confident that 80\% to 84\% of Americans in this sample think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

**Part B**: We are 95% confident that 80\% to 84\% of all Americans think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

**Part C**: If we considered many random samples of 1,390 Americans, and we calculated 95\% confidence intervals for each, 95\% of these intervals would include the true population proportion of Americans who think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between
men and women.

**Part D**: In order to decrease the margin of error to 1\%, we would need to quadruple (multiply by 4) the sample size.

# Question 2 -- Proof of COVID-19 vaccination (6 pts)

In the US, businesses and schools shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, and a vaccine became publicly available for the first time in April 2021. That month, a Gallup poll surveyed a random sample of 3,731 US adults, asking how they felt about the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for air travel. The poll found that 57\% said they would favor it. (Gallup 2021b)

**Part A**: Describe the population parameter of interest.

**Part C**: Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US adults who favored requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for travel by airplane. (Show work and final value)

**Part D**: Interpret the confidence interval.

**Part E**: Without doing any calculations, describe what would happen to the confidence interval if we decided to use a higher confidence level.

**Part F**: Without doing any calculations, describe what would happen to the confidence interval if we used a larger sample.

# Question 3 -- Is Yawning Contagious? (3 pts)

Is yawning contagious? An experiment conducted by the MythBusters, a science entertainment TV program on the Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns. 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn’t a person yawning near them (control). The visualization below displays how many participants yawned in each group.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nfriedrichsen.github.io/homework/mythbusters-chart.jpg")
```

Suppose we are interested in estimating the difference in yawning rates between the control and treatment groups using a confidence interval. Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using the normal approximation. What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?

# Question 4 -- Sleep deprivation (5 pts)

A CDC report on sleep deprivation rates shows that the proportion of California residents who reported insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding 30 days is 8.0%, while this proportion is 8.8% for Oregon residents. These data are based on simple random samples of 11,545 California and 4,691 Oregon residents.

Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the difference in proportions (Oregon - California) and interpret the interval in context.

# Question 5 -- Rainbow Trout - Bootstrapping (7 pts)

This is a continuation of the Rainbow Trout problem on HW5. We will use bootstrapping to make a confidence interval instead of the t-distribution. We will generate a sample that matches the info provided in that question. Specifically we are looking at the sinking net info. We will use this generated sample as a 'new' dataset because we don't have the original sample data in its entirety.

#### Sinking Net Fish

The average length (mm) for the fish caught in the Sinking Net was 254.972 with a standard deviation of 73.619. Sample size = 71

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

theme_set(theme_bw())

## Better histograms
gh <- function(bins = 10) {
  geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'gray80', bins = bins)
}

## Bootstrapping function
bootstrap <- function(x, statistic, n = 1000L) {
  bs <- replicate(n, {
    sb <- sample(x, replace = TRUE)
    statistic(sb)
  })
  data.frame(Sample = seq_len(n), 
             Statistic = bs)
}

set.seed(8675309)
# generate new sample
data_sink = rnorm(71, mean=254.972, sd=73.619)
```

**Part A**: Make a bootstrap distribution for the mean length of all fish caught with the sinking net using 1000 samples (use the `gh()` function from above).

```{r, echo=F, include=F}
mean_boot <- bootstrap(data_sink, mean, n=1000)
ggplot(mean_boot, aes(x=Statistic)) + gh(bins=10)
```


**Part B**: Use the `quantile()` function and the bootstrap distribution to make a 90\% CI for the mean

```{r, echo=F, include=F}
quantile(x=data_sink, probs=c(.1, .9))
```

**Part C**: Suppose the true mean length of fish caught with the *floating net* is 300mm. According the bootstrap CI, is there a difference in mean lengths for fish caught with the different net types?
