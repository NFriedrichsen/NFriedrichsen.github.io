"The power and benefits of intentional reflection are impactful! Sometimes it can be difficult to spend time reflecting on certain situations as we can become stuck in a repetitive, even negative thought process. This is because many people donâ€™t know how to reflect in a way that is helpful for individual growth. When done correctly, continued reflection can improve self-awareness, lead to personal and professional growth, assist with increasing problem-solving and decision-making skills, improve emotional intelligence and help with goal setting and achievement."
