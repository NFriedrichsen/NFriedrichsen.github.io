# Probability Rules

**Practice:** Look over and understand the probabilities lab. Questions will be *mostly* extremely similar to the labs

- Notation P()
- Disjoint events
- Conditional Probabilities
- How to check for Independence 
- Algebra
    - Complement
    - Additive Rule
    - Multiplicative Rule
- **BIG**: Get probabilities from Tables
- Calculate Odds
- Odds-Ratio
  - calculate
  - Interpret
  - association?

# Confidence Intervals

**Practice:** Look over the CI labs and understand the solutions. Questions will *mostly* be extremely similar to labs

**Practice:** Go through the CI quick-guides and know how to use formulas, use correct t or z values, and check conditions

- Sampling Distributions
- Standard Error
- Margin of Error
- 68-95-99.7\% Rule
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Goal for CIs
- **HUGE**: define/describe parameters and statistics in context
- 'confidence' meaning
- Make CI's for the 4 scenarios (formulas will be given)
- Check conditions
- Know which z* or t* value to use in CI
- Interpret CIs
- Check if certain values are plausible
- When and why do we use t-distribution instead of Normal
